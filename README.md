# Multiscale causal structure learning

This repository contains the Python code for the algorithms proposed in the paper *"Multiscale Causal Structure Learning"* by D'Acunto et al. (2023).

To run the code, you need to install the Python libraries specified in `mcsl.yml`.
Alternatively, you can create a dedicated `conda` environment using the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f mcsl.yml
```

The file `test.ipynb` shows how to apply the proposed algorithms to synthetic data.
